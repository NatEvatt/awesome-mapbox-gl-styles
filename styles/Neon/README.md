# Neon 

This map style was created by Stephen Smith who designed it originally for his blog post [Mapbox Studio Cartography](http://www.mapsmith.net/mbs/).  Stephen has been kind enough to let me post it here.  Stephen's final verision can be seen [here](http://bl.ocks.org/TheMapSmith/raw/2966bfa0af4d76c2af3a/).

## Usage

The easiest way to use this style is to add it to a Mapbox Studio Styles page.  Click 'New Style' button and select 'Upload a style' and upload this style.json file.  Upload the icons from the icons folder for each layer that uses them.
